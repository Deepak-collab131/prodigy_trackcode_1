            <h2>Welcome to the Jack's Fan Page</h2>
            <p> He can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than by force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and to fight only when necessary.</p>
            <p>Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate Hector Barbossa</p>

            <p>Jack doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, and he kind of affects everybody else.</p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Master of Improvisation :</strong> Jack often improvises during and outside of battle, allowing him to perform unpredictable actions. He is also capable of using the environment and anything around him to his advantage and/or as a weapon</li>
                <li><strong>Master Escapee :</strong> Jack is capable of escaping situations normally unavoidable by just improvising. Not only that, but there are also moments where he sets up his escape plan, as best seen during his escape from the King's palace in On Stranger Tides</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy :</strong>Jack is capable of tricking others and making himself a double agent, playing on all parties involved to benefit himself at almost any situation</li>
            </ul>
